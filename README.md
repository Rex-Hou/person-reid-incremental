# learning-without-forgetting-hybrid

## Note
The model used by original authors of [Learning without forgetting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09282) used MATCONVNET which is a toolkit for building ConvNets in MATLAB. I've used [Densely Connected Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) for multi class classification.
